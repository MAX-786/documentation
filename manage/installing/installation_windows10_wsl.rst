Installing Plone on a Windows 10 Linux Subsystem for Development
================================================================

This document is a manual for installing a `Plone CLI <https://pypi.org/project/plonecli/>`_ (and Python 3) based development environment into a Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) under Windows 10.
Ubuntu is used as the Linux distribution.
It is possible to edit the add-ons created by Plone CLI with an IDE of your choice under Windows.

Introduction
============

The following tutorial will lead you through all the steps to install and use Plone CLI on your Windows device.

Ubuntu
======

Pre Settings
------------

Before installing the shell to later configure in, the first thing to do is to enable the optional feature for a subsystem on windows.
Therefor, the programm Windows PowerShell has to be launched (as administrator! - right-click the application and choose "launch as admin").
Do not launch the Powershell ISE application, because it won't work.
In the shell the following command has to be entered.

.. code-block :: powershell

    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

If necessary, the device has to be restarted afterwards.

Download And Installing Ubuntu
------------------------------

After giving free the feature for a subsystem, the distribution package of Ubuntu can be downloaded using the following command.

.. code-block :: powershell

    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804 -OutFile Ubuntu.appx -UseBasicParsing

To install the downloaded package, execute the following command.

.. code-block :: powershell

    Add-AppxPackage .\Ubuntu.appx

Setting Up Ubuntu
-----------------

After installing the application, it can be found in the startmenu or in the apps, or by searching it.
After starting Ubuntu, it take some time to process futher installation steps and establish the needed components.
An username and password is required, indepentend of the Windows user data.

Because most distributions just deliver an outdated catalog within the download, it is recommended to instantly update the packet.
(You should execute the steps regulary to keep the system up to date).

.. code-block :: console

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Windows does not update any components of a Linux subsystem, all have to be carried out manually!

Latest Python On Ubuntu
=======================

Our Linux operating system is installed to author software, so here an explaination how to install Python.
To install one or more Python versions on the subsystem, a certain management application for it called Pyenv has to be installed.

Install Pyenv
-------------

To install Pyenv, use the command below in the Ubuntu shell.
After completing the download, the shell has to be restarted to take over all changes.

.. code-block :: console

    curl https://pyenv.run | bash

Configure Paths
---------------

To set the right paths for certain activities and to enable Pyenv local environment, edit the file ".bashrc".

.. code-block :: console

    nano .bashrc

After opening the document, at the bottom of the code 3 lines have to be appended:

.. code-block :: bash

    export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

The path is important insofar, because further commands can executed if the paths, where they have to be tapped, are known.
To apply the changes, save the document and apply them.
.. code-block :: console

    source .bashrc

Install Python
--------------

After finishing the setup, it is possible to install the needed version of Python in Ubuntu.
Before installing Python, the system needs to be prepared with a C-compiler and some libraries.
To install them, a sudo (superuser do) command (with password, configured when setting up Ubuntu shell) is needed.

.. code-block :: console

    sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
    libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
    xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg62-dev

In this case, Python version 3.7.4 is installed.
To use the language version globally, it has to be enabled first.

.. code-block :: console

    pyenv install 3.7.4
    pyenv global 3.7.4

Plone CLI
=========

We use Plone CLI to work with Plone.
Plone CLI is a command line interface for creating Plone packages, as also for building and starting Plone.

Before,the latest version of pip has to be installed.
It pulls released Python packages from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ and installs them in the current Python environment.

.. code-block :: console

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install plonecli --user

Bash Auto Completion
--------------------

To activate the autocomplete function for Plone CLI, again open the .bashrc file and fill in the following path at the end of the document.

.. code-block :: console

    nano .bashrc


.. code-block :: bash

    . ~/.local/bin/plonecli_autocomplete.sh

Afterwards, the change has to be applied again.

.. code-block :: console

    source .bashrc


Plone CLI
=========

We use Plone CLI here to work with Plone.
Plone CLI is a command line interface for creating Plone packages, as also for building and starting Plone.
Plone CLI need to be installed on the subsystem by typing the following command.

It is installed as a global user-package, so that it can be used for several projects.
Plone CLI's newest release will be pulled immediately.
While at it we install also the latest Pip first.
Pip is a Python package installer.
It pulls released Python packages from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ and installs them in the current Python environment.

.. code-block :: console

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install plonecli --user

Bash Auto Completion
--------------------

To activate the autocomplete function for Plone CLI, again the ``.bashrc`` document has to be opened and a path is inserted ate the bottom of the so far code.

Open editor.

.. code-block :: console

    nano .bashrc

Code to insert.

.. code-block :: bash

    . ~/.local/bin/plonecli_autocomplete.sh

Afterwards, the script has to be applied again.

.. code-block :: console

    source .bashrc

Creating A Plone Add-on
-----------------------

Before creating an add-on, the correct path has to be chosen.

To edit the code via Windows and execute it under Ubuntu with Plone CLI, a shared place accessible from both systems is needed.

Under Ubuntu this location is ``/mnt/c/`` for the Windows C-drive.
I.e. create a folder in Windows ``C:\Plone-Projects``. In Linux it is located under ``/mnt/c/Plone-Projects``.

In the Ubuntu shell use the ``cd`` command following with the path chosen to create the addon in.
Plone CLI asks some question to be answered before creating the custom add-on.

.. code-block :: console

    cd /mnt/c/Plone-Projects
    plonecli create addon collective.example

Edit and build add-on
---------------------

To add features to the add-on, its directory has to be entered.

.. code-block :: console

    cd /mnt/c/Plone-Projects/collective.example

Then, several featuers can be added. For example:

.. code-block :: console

    plonecli add behavior
    plonecli add content_type
    plonecli add theme
    plonecli add view
    plonecli add viewlet
    plonecli add vocabulary

For more information consult the `Plone CLI documentation <https://pypi.org/project/plonecli/>`_.

Build a package.

.. code-block :: console

    plonecli build

To start Plone so that it can be accessed from the web browser run:

.. code-block :: console

    plonecli serve

Now in Windows in your browser visit `http://locahost:8080/ <http://locahost:8080/>`_ and go on creating a Site using Plone.

To apply future changes to your configuration (buildout), run

.. code-block :: console

    plonecli buildout
