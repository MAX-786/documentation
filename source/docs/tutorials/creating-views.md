title: Creating views
---


In this chapter we are going to create a new type of view for displaying contents in a folder.
We will call this view full view.

In Plone there is a view called `All content` with the view id full_view that we will reuse.

We start by creating a file called: `components/FullView/FullView.jsx`.
