title: Semantic UI
---

Volto uses Semantic UI and React Semantic UI (via semantic-ui-less) as development framework.
It helps you to create websites with responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.

Semantic UI treats words and classes as exchangeable concepts.
Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively.
