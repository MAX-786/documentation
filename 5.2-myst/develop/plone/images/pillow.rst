Pillow (PIL Fork)
=================

Plone uses `Pillow <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow>`_, a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for low-level image manipulation and decoding, particularly for GIF, JPEG and PNG image formats.

Installing Pillow
=================

For instructions how to install Pillow and its dependencies, please read:

https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html

Note particularly the dependencies on the development packages of libjpeg and libz. Other image format support may be required for special projects, but libjpeg and libz are required for GIF, JPEG and PNG support.
