# This Is The Official Plone Documentation

You can read the documentation on [docs.plone.org](http://docs.plone.org).

## Contribute

If you want to contribute please make sure to read:

- [Our documentation about contributing](https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/index.html)
- [Our docs style-guide](https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/documentation_styleguide.html)
- [Our reST style-guide](https://docs.plone.org/about/contributing/rst-styleguide.html)

One of the best ways to start contributing to the documentation is to pick one of the tickets labeled
[First Timer](https://github.com/plone/documentation/labels/First%20Timers).

Please do not misinterpret `First Timer` as `easy` !

`First Timer` does not always mean that these tickets are suited for *beginners* or people who are new
to Plone.

For some of them you will need to know Python, Plone or Operating Systems.

Tickets labeled `First Timer` are excellent for your first contribution to the docs because,
these are accessible and straightforward.
