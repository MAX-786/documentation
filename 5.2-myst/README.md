# `5.2-myst` branch of Plone Documentation

This branch `5.2-myst` in the repository for Plone Documentation.

Its purpose is to facilitate contributors to fill gaps in the Plone 6 documentation, using Plone 5.2 documentation as a base.

This branch contains the original reStructuredText files from Plone 5.2 and converted MyST files for `plone/documentation`.
 
The conversion was performed using the following command.

```shell
rst2myst convert --no-colon-fences 5.2-myst/**/*.rst
```

No cleanup was performed.
