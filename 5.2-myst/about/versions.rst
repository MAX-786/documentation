This documentation has versions, like Plone itself.

The versions are matched to the **major** Plone releases:

- version "3" is valid for Plone 3.0 up to 3.3.x
- version "4" is valid for Plone 4.0 up to 4.3.x
- version "5" is valid for Plone 5.0 up to 5.x

In general, the documentation for a version assumes you are using the latest *minor* version.
If features became available during a minor release cycle,
for instance features that are available in Plone 5.1 but were not available in Plone 5.0, that is reflected in the text.

We plan to provide an 'unreleased' version link, to allow people to check,
proofread and improve the documentation for the upcoming Plone version(s).
