========================
The Management Interface
========================

Here be dragons.

The Management Interface is a direct interface into the backend software stack of Plone.

While it can still serve as a valuable tool for Plone specialists to fix problems or accomplish certain tasks,
it is **not** recommended as a regular tool for Plone maintenance.

If you are just starting out, this is probably not where you want to go.

If you are a Plone expert, this is where to get to the venerable Management Interface.


.. note::

   Only users with role "Manager" can use this option.
